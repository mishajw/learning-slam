# Learning SLAM

Notes and code for learning Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping.

Goals:
- High-level notes on how SLAM works, with lists of pre-requisite knowledge.
- SLAM implementation in Python that is:
  - Self-explanatory (most important)
  - Modular (to allow for experiments)
  - Fast

Theory notes are found in [./slam-theory](./slam-theory).

Python implementation is found in [./slam-py](./slam-py).
